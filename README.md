Dislocated Shoulder Detection
About the Project
Welcome to the Dislocated Shoulder Detection Project!
This project focuses on classifying X-ray shoulder scans into two categories: normal shoulders and dislocated shoulders. The journey of this project covers the complete lifecycle of a data science project, from data collection and processing to model training and performance evaluation.

Technologies Used
I developed this project using the following technologies:

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling.

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework for high-performance numerical computations.

NumPy: A powerful library for numerical operations in Python, essential for handling and manipulating large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, widely used for image processing tasks.

Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library for Python, providing data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization libraries in Python used for creating informative and visually appealing charts and plots.

Project Overview
The project follows these key steps:

Data Collection: Gathering X-ray shoulder scans for both normal and dislocated cases.

Data Processing: Preparing and cleaning the collected data to make it suitable for model training.

Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms implemented with Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to train models for shoulder classification.

Performance Evaluation: Assessing the models' performance and identifying the model with the highest accuracy.
