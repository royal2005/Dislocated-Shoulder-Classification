# Dislocated Shoulder Detection
## About the Project
This project focuses on classifying X-ray shoulder scans into two categories: normal shoulders and dislocated shoulders. The journey of this project covers the complete lifecycle of a data science project, from data collection and processing of data to model training and performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used
I developed this project using the following technologies:

#### Scikit-learn: 
A machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling.

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework for high-performance numerical computations.

#### NumPy: 
A powerful library for numerical operations in Python, essential for handling and manipulating large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

#### OpenCV: 
An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, widely used for image processing tasks.

#### Pandas: 
A data manipulation and analysis library for Python, providing data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets.

#### Matplotlib and Seaborn: 
Visualization libraries in Python used for creating informative and visually appealing charts and plots.


## Project Overview
### The project follows these key steps:

#### Data Collection: 
Gathering X-ray shoulder scans for both normal and dislocated cases.

#### Data Processing: 
Preparing the data by spliting, cleaning and resizing the data to make it suitable for model training.

#### Model Training: 
Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms implemented with Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to train models for shoulder classification.

#### Performance Evaluation: 
Assessing the models' performance and identifying the model with the highest accuracy.
